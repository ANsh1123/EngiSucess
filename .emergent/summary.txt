**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React frontend and FastAPI backend has been developed. The application features a visually-rich, modern UI with a glassmorphic dark theme and extensive animations.

The backend includes API endpoints for:
- User authentication (register, login, get user).
- AI-powered company matching (simulated).
- Resume uploading and evaluation (simulated AI).
- Job application tracking.
- AI interview feedback (simulated).
- AI learning resource recommendations (simulated).

The frontend is largely contained within a monolithic  file and a large  file. It includes the UI for registration/login, a dashboard, and stubs for all the features mentioned above, including a resume evaluator and company matching interface.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was executing a large, multi-part user request to make the application production-ready. This involved implementing several major features at once: the AI Resume Evaluator, direct job application links, AI interview feedback, personalized learning resources, and adding security measures. The agent created backend endpoints and frontend UI for all these features. The final action was taking a screenshot of the application after restarting the services.
*   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING

*   **Which testing method agent to use?**: both
*   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   **Issue 1: Comprehensive Testing of All Newly Added Features (Priority: P0)**
*   **Issue 2: Critical Frontend Architectural Flaws (Priority: P1)**

**Issues Detail:**
*   **Issue 1: Comprehensive Testing of All Newly Added Features**
    *   **Attempted fixes:** None. The features were implemented in a single large batch without any intermediate testing.
    *   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  **Backend:** Use the  agent to rigorously test all new API endpoints: , , , , and .
        2.  **Frontend:** After backend verification, ask the user for permission to run the  agent. The test should cover the full user journey: registration, login, using the resume evaluator, navigating to the company matching page, checking Apply Now links, and verifying the learning resources and interview feedback sections.
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To validate that the core features of the application are functional and meet the user's production-ready requirement.
    *   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    *   **Is recurring issue?** N
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both
    *   **Blocked on other issue:** None

*   **Issue 2: Critical Frontend Architectural Flaws**
    *   **Attempted fixes:** The agent previously tried to refactor the  component out of  but struggled with the implementation, leading to file editing errors and React hook issues. The final state of the refactoring is unverified and likely unstable.
    *   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Analyze the structure of .
        2.  Create a plan to refactor the monolithic file into smaller, manageable components (e.g., , , , etc.) within a  directory.
        3.  Ensure state management (especially auth context) is passed down correctly to the new child components.
        4.  Pay close attention to React hook rules to prevent conditional rendering errors.
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** The current monolithic structure is unstable, hard to debug, and the source of previous UI failures. Refactoring is essential for a stable, maintainable, and scalable application.
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    *   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    *   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
*   None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Upcoming Tasks:**
*   **(P0) Full-system Testing and Bug Fixing:** The immediate next step is to test all the features implemented in the last session and fix any bugs that arise. This is critical for achieving the production-ready state.
*   **(P1) Refactor Frontend Code:** Break down the monolithic  file into smaller, reusable components. Specifically, , , , , , , , and  should all be in their own files.

**Future Tasks:**
*   **(P1) Integrate Real Job Board APIs:** Replace the simulated job data with live data by integrating with APIs from LinkedIn, Indeed, etc. This will require obtaining API keys from the user.
*   **(P2) Implement LinkedIn Profile Scraping:** Enhance the user experience by scraping a user's LinkedIn profile via a URL instead of requiring manual data entry or using generated data.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Application Scaffolding:** Set up the initial FastAPI backend, React frontend, and MongoDB database.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
*   **Issue 1: Undefined Function and Unresolved Lint Errors**
    *   **Debug checklist:** The code contains unresolved ESLint errors reported during development, including  and . Search the frontend codebase (, ) for these errors and either define the missing functions/variables or correct the logic that uses them.
    *   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** These errors indicate broken functionality, specifically in the user-friendly generate sample profile feature. Fixing them is necessary for a working application.
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** Frontend
    *   **Is recurring issue?** N

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
*   None.

**All files of reference**
*   : Contains the entire backend logic for all features, including auth, company matching, resume evaluation, and more.
*   : A critical, monolithic React component that needs urgent refactoring. It controls routing, state, and the UI for almost the entire application.
*   : A large stylesheet defining the application's modern, animated look.
*   : A standalone component for the company matching feature, whose integration with  is fragile.
*   : Key Python dependencies including To use the fastapi command, please install "fastapi[standard]":

	pip install "fastapi[standard]", , , , , and .

**Areas that need refactoring**:
*   **CRITICAL:** The  file is over 1500 lines long and must be broken down into a structured component hierarchy (e.g., a  directory with individual files for each feature like , , etc.).
*   **HIGH:** The  file should be modularized, with styles scoped to their respective components to improve maintainability.
*   **MEDIUM:** The  file is growing large. Consider splitting routes and business logic into separate modules (e.g., using FastAPI's ).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
*   **PRIORITY #1: TEST AND STABILIZE.** The previous agent added a massive number of untested features. Your first priority must be to conduct thorough backend and frontend testing to identify and fix bugs. Do not add new features until the existing ones are proven to work.
*   **FRONTEND IS FRAGILE.** The application's stability is compromised by a monolithic  file. Be prepared to refactor this file to fix bugs and make the application maintainable. Previous attempts to do so failed, so proceed with a clear plan.
*   **ALL AI IS SIMULATED.** The backend logic for company matching, resume evaluation, and other AI features is currently simulated. Do not attempt to implement real machine learning models unless explicitly requested by the user.
*   **UI/UX IS IMPORTANT.** The user highly values the modern, visually appealing interface. Ensure that any fixes or refactoring preserve or enhance the current design aesthetic.
